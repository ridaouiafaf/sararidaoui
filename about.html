        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Once my studies at the Faculty of Science and Technology were finished, I turned quite naturally to the art of embroidery.<br>
          I have always been attracted to design and interior decoration, a whole world of creation was offered to me then.
          An extraordinary playground allowing me to give free rein to my imagination and let my emotions speak through the threads.<br>
          Furthermore, I was fascinated by the world of vegetal dyeing and leather which I have been discovering, learning and trying since 2019.<br>
          I seek above all to go through a photo that presents a natural scene to a piece of embroidery. I work a lot by mixing embroidery techniques,
          I continue to evolve my style by combining purely Moroccan techniques with much more contemporary and free approaches.<br>
          For the moment, I mainly have an approach of visual artist but I also sometimes work on specific orders.
