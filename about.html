        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        Once her studies at the Faculty of Science and Technology were finished, she turned quite naturally to the art of embroidery. <br>
        She has always been attracted to design and interior decoration, a whole world of creation was offered to her then; an extraordinary playground allowing her to give free rein to her imagination and let her emotions speak through the threads. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Having grown up in a village around Oued Oum Rabii, nature is an important inspiration in her daily life. Her love for nature and embroidery made her do what she is doing today.
        </p>
        <p>
        I her works, she always seeks to go through a photograph that presents a beautiful natural scene and tranform it to a piece of embroidery art. She works a lot by mixing various embroidery techniques while continuing to evolve her style by combining pure Moroccan techniques with much more contemporary and free approaches. <br> 
        <br> For the moment, she mainly has an approach of visual artist but she also work on specific, customed and personalized orders for clients.
