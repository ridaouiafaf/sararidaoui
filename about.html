        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        Once her studies at the Faculty of Science and Technology were finished, she turned quite naturally to the art of embroidery. <br>
She has always been attracted to design and interior decoration, a whole world of creation was offered to her then. <br>
An extraordinary playground allowing her to give free rein to her imagination and let her emotions speak through the threads. 
        </p>
        <p>
        And having grown up in a village around Oued Oum Rabii, nature is an important inspiration in her daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
        Her love for nature and embroidery make her able to do what she is doing today.
        </p>
        <p>
        She seeks above all to go through a photograph that presents a beautiful natural scene and tranformate it to a piece of embroidery. She works a lot by mixing embroidery techniques, she continue to evolve her style by combining purely Moroccan techniques with much more contemporary and free approaches. <br> 
For the moment, she mainly has an approach of visual artist but she also work on specific orders.
